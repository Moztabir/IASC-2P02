     <h2>1.Flatness</h2>
     <p><span class="clickable"id ="part-one">From inside the cave</span></p>

     <p>The people in the cave have never seen anything outside their world. All they know is the wall in front of them, where shadows move and change. One shadow, a thin line, moves up and down, stretching and shrinking. They don’t know why it happens, but they believe it is important. Some think it is a message from something greater, while others are afraid of what it means. Since they have never seen anything else, they don’t question the shadow’s existence. One day, the line starts<span class="clickable"id="first-change">moving up and down on the wall</span>. making some think it is trying to rise into the sky or break free from the 4 wall <span class="clickable"id="second-change"> Then, it stretches and shrinks</span>, which confuses them even more. The people start making up stories about what is happening. Some believe it is a warning, while others think it is a sign of something good. They never stop to ask what might be causing it. Since they only see the shadow, they have no idea that something else is happening outside the cave. To them, the shadow is the only reality, and they don’t realize they are missing the full picture.</p>

     <p>The concept of "flatness," as proposed by Nick Sousanis, describes how people might become confined to seeing only a portion of the truth while entirely ignoring everything else. Since you are unaware of all of the information, I define flatness as having a very restricted comprehension of something. Your beliefs are based on what you observe. Because they are unaware that the shadow on the wall is not the actual object, the people in the cave must overcome this. They are unaware that they are merely witnessing a tiny portion of something larger, and they believe the line is all there is to it. Their perception of the world is constrained, flat, and narrow since it is focused solely on what they can perceive. They do not know that a light source and an actual object are creating these shadows. Instead, they believe that the changing line is a force on its own. Since they never question their surroundings, they never figure out the truth. They live their lives thinking that shadows are reality, never realizing there is more beyond what they can see.</p>

     <h2>2.Seeing Double</h2>
     <p><span class="clickable"id= "part-two">From outside the cave</span></p>

     <P>Outside the cave, the truth is completely different. The shadow is not a mysterious force; it is just the shadow of a smiley face disc. The object is a yellow, flat circle with a face on it. It hangs in front of a light source, and when the light shines past it, only a thin shadow appears on the cave wall. The people outside the cave can see the full smiley face. They know that the cave dwellers are only seeing a small part of it, but the people inside will never know that. The shadow on the wall changes when the<span class="clickable"id="third-change"> smiley face moves slightly rotates</span> showing of what it truely is.  If the smiley face stretches or shrinks, the shadow also <span class="clickable"id="fourth-change"> gets longer or shorter </span>The people outside the cave can see the connection between the shadow and the real object. They know that the cave dwellers are misunderstanding what they see, but they also understand why. Since the people inside have never seen anything else, it makes sense that they believe the shadow is real. They don’t know any better. Meanwhile, the people outside the cave see everything as it actually is and realize that the cave dwellers are missing an important part of reality.
     </P>

     <p>Seeing Double, according to definition by Nick Sousanis, is the capacity to view objects from many angles. Seeing Double, in my opinion, is realising that not everything we perceive is accurate. Only a line is visible to those inside the cave, and they believe that to be the actual thing. However, the shadow and the smiling face that casts it are both visible to anyone outside the cave. They realise that a seemingly straightforward line on the wall is actually a component of a larger, more intricate whole. The people outside can simultaneously see the illusion and the reality, while the cave dwellers are unaware of the complete truth and believe it to be their entire universe. This shows how much perspective changes what people see and believe in. Those inside the cave think they understand their world, but they are only seeing a small part of it. The people outside know that the shadow is just an effect of the real object. As the sun begins to set, the light changes, and the shadows shift again. The cave dwellers will see a new movement and make up new meanings for it, but they will still never see the full truth. Only by stepping outside the cave would they ever understand what they have been missing.</p>
